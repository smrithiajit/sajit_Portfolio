## Datascience projects

## [Data Mining Project 1: Comparison of Military Spending between countries](https://github.com/smrithiajit/Projects/blob/master/DATS%2B6103%2BSMRITHI%2BAJIT.ipynb)

The overall objective was to analyze the military spending of top 10 nations in terms of military spending.
The following aspects were examined

1.	The top 10 countries with the greatest military spending were identified.
2.	The average military expenditure of these top 20 countries was compared.
3.	The military spending of these countries was represented as a percentage of their GDP
4.	The per capita military spending was compared to the per capita GDP
5.	The percentage variation in their spending was compared in the span 2007-2016

## [Data Mining Project Project 2: Data Mining Project: Comparison of Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://github.com/smrithiajit/Projects/blob/master/DATS6103SMRITHIAJIT11DEC.ipynb)

The overall objective was to identify countries with high greenhouse gas emissions and analyze the greenhouse gas emissions of these countries

## [Comparison of GAM and Deep Learning in liver disease prediction](https://github.com/smrithiajit/Projects/blob/master/Comparison_of_GAMmodellingwithDeepLearning.pdf)
This project aims develop and compare GAM modelling technique with Deep Learning 
modelling technique to help predict if a patient is a liver patient or not based on 
parameters available from liver function test results. Their performance was evaluated 
and compared based on a combination of rmse, AUC and GAM performance plots. 
Additionally, the author has attempted to understand how data curing techniques can 
help to improve model and has also made an attempt to develop a representative or 
index dataset that can be used to represent the complete dataset using GA-NMM 
method.
